# Final Project

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This project took data from a grocery store sales list and compiled how much of each item was sold. It took a lot of raw data and made it more pallatable for the end user.

What did you do particularly well?
-I was extremely happy with the result of my program. It performed all functions intended and I was happy with the way it was written. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I need to be better with my commenting. I feel that my program could be tuned to be more efficient with some time 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-My biggest struggle was getting C++ to communicate with Python correctly. I watched multiple youtube videos and watched the original setup video many times to iron out the kinks of my program.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-This project was a great example of using multiple programming languages at a time and I was also able to maniuplate a data set in python into pallateble data for the end user.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I neglected to comment my code, making it much harder to read. I put everything in functions which does help with maintainability, but without comments its tough to follow. Moving forward a need to make commenting a routine practice whilst writing programs.
